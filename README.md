# iBanana_RiceTracker
A personal project to organize and visualize my college courses for all 4 years.


Based mainly on Google Sheets for mobility, I wanted a better way to see what classes I need to take for my majors and make sure I address all graduation requirements along the way. 

This was in AppScript, javascript for Sheets (basically all this repo is). I've begun using it to do the more complex tasks. This was noteably also a fun use of class structure and recursion.
